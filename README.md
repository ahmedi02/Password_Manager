# Password_Manager
I created a Password Manager using python as one of my side cybersecurity projects
You may ask, what is/does a Password Manager?
This code is an attempt to improve password usability and security, enabling users to create unique, complex passwords for every online account without needing to remember them. All information is securely stored in a password vault and accessible via the password manager.
